Sarah and John discuss their recent university exam, both finding it tough and expressing concern over specific questions, especially one on quantum mechanics. They both struggled with the multiple-choice questions and are anxious about the results, which they expect next week. They decide to meet at the library the next afternoon to review their answers and understand where they might have gone wrong, hoping to improve their performance in future exams.
