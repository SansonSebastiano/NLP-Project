29/06/24, 2:00 PM - Sarah: Hey John, how did the exam go for you?

29/06/24, 2:02 PM - John: Hey Sarah, it was tough! Some questions were really tricky. How about you?

29/06/24, 2:05 PM - Sarah: Same here. I struggled with the last question about quantum mechanics. ðŸ˜“

29/06/24, 2:08 PM - John: Oh, that one was brutal! I wasn't sure about the second part of it at all.

29/06/24, 2:10 PM - Sarah: Me neither. I just hope I got enough right to pass. Did you manage to finish all the questions?

29/06/24, 2:12 PM - John: Barely! I skipped a couple and went back at the end. How about you?

29/06/24, 2:15 PM - Sarah: I finished, but I was rushing towards the end. Did you find the multiple-choice questions easier?

29/06/24, 2:18 PM - John: A bit, but there were a few that had very close answers. I second-guessed myself a lot.

29/06/24, 2:20 PM - Sarah: Same here. I'm really anxious about the results. When do we get them?

29/06/24, 2:22 PM - John: I think Professor Smith said we'd get them next week. Fingers crossed!

29/06/24, 2:25 PM - Sarah: Yeah, fingers crossed! Do you want to review some of the questions later?

29/06/24, 2:28 PM - John: Sure, that sounds good. Maybe we can figure out where we went wrong.

29/06/24, 2:30 PM - Sarah: Exactly. Let's meet at the library tomorrow afternoon?

29/06/24, 2:32 PM - John: Perfect, see you then at 3 PM.

29/06/24, 2:35 PM - Sarah: See you! We've got this. ðŸ’ª
