Lisa suggests grabbing a beer that evening. Mark and James are keen on the idea. James recommends a good downtown spot and shares an audio file with no text, likely a quick review. Lisa agrees to the suggestion and they decide on meeting at 8 PM. Mark confirms and considers inviting others, but they opt to keep it among themselves for a more intimate catch-up. They plan to meet at 8 PM for their evening out.
