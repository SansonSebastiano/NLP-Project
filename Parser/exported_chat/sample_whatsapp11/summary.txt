In the chat, Alex and Jamie discuss the interview process for a new role. Jamie explains that the process begins with a phone screening to assess fit, followed by an in-person or video interview with the hiring manager. There may also be a technical assessment or case study. After interviews, the panel debriefs to evaluate candidates' skills, fit, and potential. Jamie notes that gaps in candidates' skills are considered in terms of trainability and alignment with team culture. Common mistakes include inadequate company research and poor demonstration of problem-solving skills. Alex appreciates the insights and Jamie emphasizes the importance of thorough evaluations and constructive feedback.
