30/06/24, 10:01 AM - Emma: Hey Alex! Super excited! Can't wait to explore the city. Have you thought about our itinerary yet?
30/06/24, 10:02 AM - Alex: IMG_01.jpg I have a few ideas. How about starting with a visit to the Sagrada Familia? Look how beautiful it is inside
30/06/24, 10:03 AM - Emma: Yes, that's a must-see! We should book tickets in advance though.
30/06/24, 10:04 AM - Alex: Good point. I'll handle the bookings. What do you think about a day trip to Park Güell after that?
30/06/24, 10:05 AM - Emma: That sounds perfect. We can have a picnic there too.
30/06/24, 10:06 AM - Alex: Great idea! How about spending an evening strolling down La Rambla?
30/06/24, 10:07 AM - Emma: Definitely! And we should check out the Boqueria Market for some local food.
30/06/24, 10:08 AM - Alex: Absolutely. I'm also thinking we can visit the Gothic Quarter for some history and cool architecture.
30/06/24, 10:09 AM - Emma: Yes! And maybe catch a flamenco show in the evening?
30/06/24, 10:10 AM - Alex: That would be amazing. I've heard Tablao Cordobés is a great place for that.
30/06/24, 10:11 AM - Emma: Perfect. Also, we shouldn't miss the beach. A relaxing day at Barceloneta would be nice.
30/06/24, 10:12 AM - Alex: Agreed. We can rent bikes and ride along the beach.
30/06/24, 10:13 AM - Emma: Sounds fun! We should also find some time for the Picasso Museum.
30/06/24, 10:14 AM - Alex: Definitely. I'll add it to our list. Any other places you want to visit?
30/06/24, 10:15 AM - Emma: Maybe Montjuïc Hill for the Magic Fountain show?
30/06/24, 10:16 AM - Alex: Yes! That show is spectacular. I'll make sure we have that in our itinerary.
30/06/24, 10:17 AM - Emma: Thanks, Alex. This is going to be an awesome trip!
30/06/24, 10:18 AM - Alex: Can't wait! I'll finalize the bookings and send you the details soon.
30/06/24, 10:19 AM - Emma: Sounds good. Talk to you later!
