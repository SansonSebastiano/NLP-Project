29/06/2024, 8:35 PM - Alex: And that assist from Barella, so smooth!
29/06/2024, 8:36 PM - Sam: I think Milan's defense just couldn't keep up.
29/06/2024, 8:37 PM - Jordan: Agreed. They looked so disorganized at the back.
29/06/2024, 8:38 PM - Chris: As a Milan fan, this was painful to watch 😩
29/06/2024, 8:39 PM - Jamie: Same here, Chris. Milan just didn't show up tonight.

29/06/2024, 8:41 PM - Chris: It was a great goal, but Milan's defense was nowhere to be seen.
29/06/2024, 8:42 PM - Casey: That was a textbook counter. Quick and precise.

29/06/2024, 8:47 PM - Chris: Lautaro was great, but Milan should have marked him better.
29/06/2024, 8:48 PM - Taylor: Yeah, he was brilliant. Do you think Inter can keep up this form for the rest of the season?
29/06/2024, 8:49 PM - Casey: If they play like this, definitely. They've got a strong squad.
29/06/2024, 8:50 PM - Jamie: Milan needs to regroup and fix their defense ASAP.
